Project Title
CollabLens – See the Kindness in Collaboration

Problem
In group projects, not everyone’s voice is heard equally.

Quieter contributors get overshadowed.

Recognition often goes only to the loudest or most visible work.

The journey — full of struggles, breakthroughs, and kindness — gets lost in favor of the end result.

This leads to frustration, inequality, and missed opportunities for empathy.

Solution
CollabLens is a real-time visualization tool that:

Captures contributions from all team members (ideas, feedback, tasks).

Anonymizes inputs during ideation so ideas are judged on merit, not personality.

Tracks the collaboration journey — highlighting ups and downs, challenges, and support moments.

Visualizes team dynamics in a beautiful, empathy-building timeline.

Generates a “Kindness Report” at the end, giving fair recognition to everyone’s contributions.

Key Features
Anonymous Suggestion Mode – Level playing field during brainstorming.

Contribution Streams – Each person’s inputs shown as a color-coded line on a shared timeline.

Kindness Heatmap – Sentiment analysis of messages and feedback to highlight supportive interactions.

Journey View – Peaks (breakthroughs) and valleys (setbacks) mapped to show the real story.

Idea Evolution Threads – Traces how raw suggestions evolved into final outputs through collaboration.

Recognition Poster – Automatically generated visual celebrating everyone’s contributions.

Why It Fits the “Kindness Quest” Theme
Kindness – Recognizes and celebrates all contributions, not just the final output.

Empathy – Shows the human side of teamwork, including struggles and moments of support.

Cooperation – Encourages fairer participation by anonymizing and balancing input.

Hackathon Build Scope (24–36h)
Frontend – React + Chart.js/D3.js for visuals.

Backend – Firebase/Supabase for real-time updates.

AI Layer – OpenAI API for sentiment analysis + clustering idea evolution.

Demo Data – Simulate a short “project journey” so the judges can see the visualization in action.
